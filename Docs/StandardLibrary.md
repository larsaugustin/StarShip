- Comparisons
    - `eql` Two Arguments → Bool
        - Checks if two values are equal. Returns the result of the comparison.
    - `big` Two Numbers → Bool
        - Checks if the first number is bigger than the second one. Returns the result of the comparison.
    - `sml` Two Numbers → Bool
        - Checks if the first number is smaller than the second one. Returns the result of the comparison.
- Number operations
    - `inc` One Number → Number
        - Returns the number incremented by one.
    - `dec` One Number → Number
        - Returns the number decremented by one.
    - `add` Multiple Numbers → Number
        - Adds numbers. Can take multiple arguments, but requires two. Returns the result of the addition.
    - `sub` Multiple Numbers → Number
        - Subtracts numbers. Can take multiple arguments, but requires two. Returns the result of the subtraction.
    - `mul` Multiple Numbers → Number
        - Multiplies numbers. Can take multiple arguments, but requires two. Returns the result of the multiplication.
    - `div` Multiple Numbers → Number
        - Divides numbers. Can take multiple arguments, but requires two. Returns the result of the division.
- Others
    - `for` Number & Function Name → Number
        - Calls a function multiple times. How many times the function will be executed is determined by the first argument. Can't take any other arguments (for now) and returns the first argument.
    - `if` Bool & Function Name → Bool
        - Calls a function if the first argument is `True`. Can't take any other arguments (for now) and returns the first argument.
    - `exit` No Arguments → Exit
        - Exits the program
